# Assignment 1
This is your assignment repo. It was created when you accepted the assignment on GitHub Classroom.

## Getting Started
To get started on the programming portion of this assignment, simply clone this repository to some local space (e.g., your file space on the ENGR servers); complete `main.cpp`; and then stage, commit, and push your work back to this repo. You can do this following the same steps as you did in lab 1. For your convenience, here are those steps (Important: These steps assume that you've already configured SSH keys to authenticate with GitHub from the ENGR servers; if you haven't done this, complete lab 1 before continuing):

1. Copy this repo's SSH URL by clicking on the "<> Code" button at the topright of this repo's main page (probably the page that you're reading this text in right now), selecting the "SSH" tab, and clicking on the clipboard icon
2. Open your terminal and connect to the ENGR servers via SSH
3. Using commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd`, navigate to the directory in which you want to store all of your assignment work for this class.
4. Execute `git clone <PASTE SSH URL FOR THIS REPO HERE>`
5. Execute `ls`. There will now be a new directory called `go-hooping-XXX`, where `XXX` is your GitHub username. Enter that directory via `cd`.
6. Execute `ls`. You should now be able to see this file (`README.md`) along with `main.cpp`. Use `vim` to edit and complete `main.cpp`, as per the assignment requirements in the assignment description document.

## Submitting your work
As you work on your assignment, you should **frequently** test your code and create new commits reflecting the small changes that you've made since the last commit (remember---VCS helps you rollback your changes to an old commit in case you accidentally break something, but this is only useful if you make new commits frequently).

To submit your work, all you have to do is:
1. Make sure that all of your work has been reflected in your latest commit (`main.cpp` should be in a committed state---`git status` should not report it to be in a modified state)
2. Push all of your commits back to this GitHub repo via `git push`
3. Open this repo in your browser, refresh the page, and verify that it contains your latest work

The instructor and TAs have access to this GitHub repo, so as long as your work has been pushed here, you can consider it submitted. Note that we will check the timestamp of your latest commit to determine whether it's a late submission (review the course's late policy in the syllabus).
